 * Mode policy (Codex `mode-and-plan-process-audit.md` absorption — Phase 3).
 *
 * Mode is more than a prompt nudge: it controls tool admissibility at the
 * dispatch seam. `plan`, `review`, and `audit` are all READ-ONLY task postures
 * (Codex's checkpoint-and-choose / findings-first / contract-vs-truth shapes
 * all forbid mutating side effects mid-loop). `default` is the legacy
 * assume-and-execute posture: mutating tools allowed.
 *
 * This file generalizes the prior `plan.ts` boolean gate into a typed enum
 * gate. `plan.ts` is kept as a thin deprecated alias so existing callers
 * compile unchanged; dispatch and new callers should route through this
 * module.

/** Modes that PERMIT mutating tools. Phrased as a positive (mutating-allowed)
 *  set rather than the inverse (read-only) so the default for any UNKNOWN
 *  mode value at runtime is to BLOCK mutating tools — fail-closed. A future
 *  read-only mode addition (e.g. "debug") gets the safe posture automatically
 *  even if someone forgets to update this gate; an inverse `READ_ONLY_MODES`
 *  list would silently grant write access to the new mode. */
