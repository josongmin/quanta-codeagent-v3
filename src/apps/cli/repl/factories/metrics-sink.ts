/** ADR-0064 L4: the default per-turn work-metrics sink. The collector + emit are
 *  already wired in the loop (gated on `AgentConfig.workMetricsSink`), but no
 *  DEFAULT sink existed so the metrics were collected and dropped. This wires
 *  one human-readable `work: <summary>` line per turn to stderr — the SAME
 *  surface the cost/cache dashboard renders to. Gated on `enabled` (the same
 *  `QUANTA_METRICS` knob); OFF ⇒ `undefined` so the loop allocates no collector
 *  (byte-identical). Extracted from `runRepl` to keep it under the biome
 *  cognitive-complexity budget. */
