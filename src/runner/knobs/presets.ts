/**
 * Named presets — convenience bundles of knob values, applied as the
 * LOWEST-priority overlay above defaults (an individual env var ALWAYS wins
 * over a preset value; see `resolve.ts` layer precedence).
 *
 * The contents are intentionally simple (knob-id -> string) so the resolver
 * can treat them identically to env vars / config-file entries. Every key MUST
 * be a registered framework-knob `id` (unknown ids are silently dropped by the
 * resolver) — for bench that means a knob declared under
 * `src/runner/knobs/knobs/` with `surfaces` including `"bench"`. Several bench
 * knobs are NOOP-apply (issue-hint / repro-test / issue-hint-expected-actual /
 * read-outline / test-runner / retry-transient): they exist as registry knobs
 * so the resolver + report + this preset layer can see them; their EFFECT is
 * delivered out of band by the bench driver (`benchPostureFromState` projection
 * + `setKnobOverride` bridge in `buildConfig`).
 *
 * ── VERSIONED PRESET CONVENTION (reproducibility) ───────────────────────────
 * Benchmark presets are NAMED and VERSIONED and treated as IMMUTABLE: the
 * contents of `agentless-v1` are frozen so a result tagged `preset:agentless-v1`
 * is reproducible forever. NEVER edit a `-vN` preset in place — if the
 * recommended posture changes, add `agentless-v2`. (The
 * `bench-preset-drives-config-hellgate` snapshot test trips on any in-place
 * edit of a frozen preset.) The unversioned `agentless-full` / `everything` /
 * `hint-only` entries below are RETAINED for back-compat with existing sweeps /
 * the `/knobs preset` listing; prefer the `-v1` names for new runs.
